# Software Crashing
## Possible Causes
1) Corrupted and missing files

2) Software Incompatibility

## Solutions
1) Perform a system file checker scan. Running an SFC scan helps
identify corrupted or missing sytem files that's probably making certain apps to crash. If the scan finds an issue, it will attempt to repair it automatically

2) Install a newer version of the software. If the software you're using keeps crashing after updating to windows 10, It could mean that the software is not compatible with the windows 10
