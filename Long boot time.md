# Long Boot times
## Possible Reasons
1) How many startup programs do you have running? 

2) Do you know if you have an SSD installed?

3) Have you updated your graphics card driver recently?

## Solutions

1) Try disabling programs that have a high startup impact in task manager
(ie. the inventory management, sales tracking and customer order programs you are using), program startup are programs that start 
running once you open your computer

2) It's possible your machine could use an upgrade. A hard disk drive (HDD) is usually slower than its counter part the SSD.
   An SSD can help speed up the boot time of your computer.It wont be cheap but it will help in the long run

3) The newer versions of windows are known to mess with drivers. You probably have an outdated graphics driver card. Updating it can sometimes fix boot issues
